#### A little about me

At my core I am a passionate problem solver and unwavering optimist. I believe that all obstacles can be viewed as welcome challenges and I am always looking for a way to improve my environment and community. Today, in tech I am passionate about creating user-focused applications that dynamically add value for users. My innovative drive paired with my experience in back-end engineering and team-driven workspaces are assets that I look forward to bringing to my role as your next Software Engineer.

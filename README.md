As a first generation American, leaving every environment better than I found it is both the cornerstone of my personal values and an inherited cultural principle. Coming from a background in Hospitality Management, I was regularly faced with problem solving opportunities. My goal then remains my goal today: anticipate needs and exceed expectations. Whether I was redeveloping Human Resources Management Systems, supporting a team of 25 employees, or developing COVID-19 safety protocols, I viewed every obstacle as a welcome challenge. I am passionate about tech as a vehicle to create human-focused solutions to a wider variety of welcome challenges. My experiences in management and team-driven workspaces are assets that I look forward to bringing to my role as your next Software Engineer.

Thanks for stopping by!

#### A little about me

At my core I am a passionate problem solver and unwavering optimist. I believe that all obstacles can be viewed as welcome challenges and I am always looking for away to improve my environment and community. Coming from a background in Hospitality Management, I regularly relied on this skill and outlook. Today, in tech I am passionate about creating user-focused applications that dynamically value for the folks that use them. My innovative drive paired with my experience in management and team-driven workspaces are assets that I look forward to bringing to my role as your next Software Engineer.
